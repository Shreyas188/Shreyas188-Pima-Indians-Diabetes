# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
📊 Project Overview

This project explores and implements various supervised learning models to classify whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes. It demonstrates essential data science steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

📁 Files Included

diabetes.csv – Dataset with 768 records, each containing 8 medical input features and a binary outcome.

Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Dataset.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook covering:

Data loading and inspection

Handling missing and zero values

Visualizations (distribution plots, heatmaps)

Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

🔧 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn for model development and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

🎯 Objective

To build a robust, reproducible ML model that can assist in early diabetes prediction using routine diagnostic measurements. The goal is to support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions through data.
