# Pima-Indians-Diabetes
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to explore and build machine learning models for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on key clinical features. The objective is to develop a reproducible ML pipeline that supports early detection and can be integrated into health diagnostic systems.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Using medical data collected from female patients of Pima Indian heritage, this notebook walks through every major step of a data science workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Model development and training

Performance evaluation and comparison

 Files Included
diabetes.csv â€“ Dataset containing 768 patient records with 8 clinical features (glucose, insulin, BMI, etc.) and a target label.

Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Dataset.ipynb â€“ A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that:

Performs data cleaning and handles missing/zero values

Visualizes distributions and correlation heatmaps

Builds predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics

 Techniques & Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix

Data normalization and feature engineering

 Objective
To accurately predict the onset of diabetes using routine diagnostic data, assisting healthcare professionals in making faster and data-informed decisions.
